<h3>
  The bubble game is a fun and interactive web-based game where players see multiple bubbles with random numbers and aim to click on the bubbles matching a specific "Hit Number" displayed on the screen. The objective is to correctly pop the bubbles with the target number before time runs out, while avoiding wrong clicks that reduce lives.

Key features of the game include:

Dynamic bubble generation: Numbers or special bubbles appear randomly and update as you play.

Target number ("Hit Number"): Players must find and click the bubbles matching this number.

Scoring and levels: Correct clicks add to your score, and passing score milestones increases the game level, making it more challenging by adding more bubbles and wider number ranges.

Lives and timer: Players start with a certain number of lives, lose one for each wrong click, and race against the clock with a countdown timer.

Special bubbles: Some bubbles function as bonuses, granting extra points or time, while others are bombs that cause immediate life loss.

Combo and multiplier system: Consecutive correct hits increase a score multiplier to reward skilled play.

Pause and resume: You can pause and resume the game at any time.

Visual and audio feedback: Animations (like bubble pops and highlights) and sounds enhance player engagement.

High score tracking: The game saves high scores locally to encourage replayability.

Gameplay consists of identifying and clicking the right bubbles as quickly and accurately as possible before running out of time or lives, providing a stimulating test of reaction and attention.
